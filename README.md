This is a very good snek indeed. Play it, taste it, rate it! ~Wierzba


This is a project that started as a simple 2d game, then it became thos monstrosity that needs to be refactored and needs a lot of comments. They are not there due to a lot of quick decisions of just adding more and more features.
I also focused more on "making it work" rather than making it sensible by adding comments/refactoring my code.
It was created mostly to get used to the idea of classes in c++ and learning how to use GLEW and GLFW.
But due to lack of comments, a lot of what is there is quite hard to understand for me, since I did not change functions to manage display in quite a while.
